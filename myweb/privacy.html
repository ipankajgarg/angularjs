<p class="new">
This Privacy Statement was last updated on August 2, 2017.
Halanx may collect personal information to help you place and receive delivery orders and to improve the Halanx service. This Privacy Statement explains how Halanx Technologies Pvt Ltd.

</p>
<div class="row">Use of Cookies</div>
<p class="new">We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar technologies (“Cookies”) to collect information and personalize your experience with our Services. Cookies are small web files that a site or its provider transfers to your device’s hard drive through your web browser that enables the site’s or provider’s system to recognize your browser and remember certain information. We use Cookies to improve your convenience, for example, to recognize you when you return to Halanx and to remember information you have already provided, such as items already in your order cart. We also use Cookies to collect information about your activities over time and across third party websites or other online services in order to deliver content and advertising tailored to your interests.

You can choose whether to enable the location tracking feature through the settings on your device or Platform or when prompted by the Halanx mobile app. If you choose to disable the location feature, the Shopper will not receive precise location information from your device, which may compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance, if you are located in a large area, such as a park.</p>

<p class="new">
To help us run our business, we may share your information, including your contact information, ratings, other information you provide directly, and information collected automatically, with entities that provide services to us, including third parties that provide payment processing, advertising services, web analytics, data processing, IT services, customer support and other services.

We may also disclose aggregate, anonymous information to these third party retailers.</p>
<div class="row row1">When required by law</div>
<p class="new">We recognize that information related to your orders could contain private information. However, we may be required to disclose your information to third parties including law enforcement agencies when required to protect and defend our legal rights, protect the safety and security of users of our Services, prevent fraud, comply with the law, respond to legal process, or a request for cooperation by a government entity.</p>
<div class="row row1">Corporate Transactions</div>
<p class="new">In the event of sale, transfer, merger, reorganization, dissolution, or similar event we may transfer your information to one or more third parties as part of that transaction.</p>
<div class="row">Accessing and Correcting you Personal Information</div>

For example, we are required to retain records relating to previous purchases through our Services for financial reporting and compliance reasons. In addition, because of the way we maintain certain services, after you delete certain information, we may temporarily retain backup copies of such information before it is permanently deleted.</p>
